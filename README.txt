Perfect Fit is a clothing website that allows users to create a personalized avatar and see how they look in outfits from actual brands. Users can compare sizes across different brands, build outfits, and discover stores that carry the items. Our goal is to create an immersive shopping experience with a clean, elegant design that instantly engages users.
